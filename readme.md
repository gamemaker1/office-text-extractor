# Text Extraction from MS Office and PDF files

[![Node.js Tests](https://github.com/gamemaker1/office-text-extractor/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gamemaker1/office-text-extractor/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Yet another library to extract text from MS Office (`docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`) and PDF (`pdf`) files.

## Similar libraries

There are other great libraries that do the same job and have inspired this project, such as:

- [`any-text`](https://github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/any-text)
- [`officeparser`](https://github.com/harshankur/officeParser)
- [`textract`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/textract)

### How this is different from other text extraction tools

- Parses file based on mime type, not file extension
- Does not spawn a child process to use a tool installed on the device
- Reads and returns text from file if it is a simple text file

## Libraries used

This module uses some amazing existing libraries that perform better than the ones that originally existed in this module, and are therefore used instead:

- [`pdf-parse`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse), for parsing PDF files
- [`xlsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx), for parsing MS Excel files
- [`mammoth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mammoth), for parsing MS Word files

This module also uses:

- [`xml2js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js) - to convert the MS Office XML files into JSON
- [`js-yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) - to convert JSON into YAML
- [`file-type`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-type) - to detect the mime type of files
- [`decompress`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/decompress) - to unzip files
- [`read-chunk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-chunk) - to read chunks of data from large files

A big thank you to the contributors of these projects.

## Installation

To use this in an npm project, simply type in:

```sh
npm install office-text-extractor
```

**There is no support for browser environments yet. If you want to add support, please feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/gamemaker1/office-text-extractor/pulls).**

## Usage

```js
// Importing the library:

// CommonJS import
const extractText = require('office-text-extractor')

// ES/TS import
import extractText from 'office-text-extractor'

// Extracting text:

// Async-await way
const text = await extractText('path/to/file')
console.log(text)

// Promise way
extractText('path/to/file')
  .then((text) => {
    console.log(text)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
```

## Tests

To run tests (using Ava), type the following:

```sh
npm test
```

## Todos

- [x] ~~Add tests~~
- [x] ~~Add typescript typings~~
- [ ] Add callback support
- [ ] Add support for Open Office formats
- [ ] Add support for browser environments
